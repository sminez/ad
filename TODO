:: TODO

- [x] Display pending keys in the RHS of the message bar
- [x] sign/number column
- [x] Mini-buffer
  - This will replace the current prompt functionality as the primary way
    for the user to provide commands to the editor other than Normal mode
- [ ] Better colors for the status bar
  - Maybe change the color based on the mode?
- [x] Command mode
  - This probably needs to be a special case that works more like
    the current prompt mode?
  - Actually...this probably wants to be more like the emacs mini-buffer?
    - If I do it that way, then the "default" mini-buffer is just a single
      line but it should be possible to show more detail either above (like
      kakoune) or below (like emacs).
- [ ] mini-buffer tab complete
- [ ] completion of command mode commands
  - To start with this should be simple enough for handling just what is built in
    but supporting listing external scripts and tools would be nice as well
- [ ] Running shell commands
- [ ] Proper implementation of Sam style `dot`
- [ ] Port over the normal mode actions from poe
  - This will require rewriting the impls as they depend on rope data structures
- [x] Search
- [x] Buffer switch
- [x] cwd and cwd manipulation
  - buffer paths should be converted to absolute and displayed relative to cwd
- [x] Opening files from within the editor
- [ ] clipboard support
  - Probably want to look at kakboard for this one / just use xclip & pbcopy
  - true "native" support in ad will require knowing OS specific code
- [ ] FUSE filesystem fun...!
- [ ] Mouse support
- [x] handle terminal resize
- [ ] window splitting
  - This is one where I don't know if I definitely want it or not?
  - It might be better to just rely on tmux but then that forces me into the multi
    process route with a server/client model rather than a single editor and then
    the filesystem stuff for external programs to _extend_ functionality.
    In the client/server model then _everything_ needs to be RPC...which might be
    ok given the current `Action` driven model? The main issue becomes where the
    buffer state lives and how thin the client is.
