:: TODO

- [ ] Display pending keys in the RHS of the message bar
- [x] sign/number column
- [ ] Better colors for the status bar
  - Maybe change the color based on the mode?
- [ ] Command mode
  - This probably needs to be a special case that works more like
    the current prompt mode?
- [ ] Port over the normal mode actions from poe
  - This will require rewriting the impls as they depend on rope data structures
- [ ] Search
- [ ] Buffer switch
- [ ] FUSE filesystem fun...!
