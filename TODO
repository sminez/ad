-- BUGS --
- [!] Dragging the cursor back over itself is broken in a way I don't fully understand
      yet.
- [!] buffer details for the initial scratch file seem to cause errors when requesting
      the control file details through fsys?
      - Also seems to happen with a new file that is being created
      - It _might_ be something to do with special handling around naming new files?

-- Misc / Editor features --
- [ ] FEATURE: Edit log transactions
	  - paste should always be a new transaction
- [ ] FEATURE: store "desired x" or an "x is at EOL" flag?
- [ ] FEATURE: mini-buffer tab complete
- [ ] FEATURE: completion of command mode commands
      - To start with this should be simple enough for handling just what is built in
        but supporting listing external scripts and tools would be nice as well
- [ ] FEATURE: support opening and navigating directories

-- Fsys --
- [ ] sed edit in place doesn't seem to work because it needs to be able to create temp
      files right next to the file that is being edited.
      - "cat mnt/buffers/1/body | sed 's/test/TEST/' >mnt/buffers/1/body" just truncates
        the file but this is normal behaviour for sed so not an issue with ad
- [ ] decide on the event format for the events file and implement the events file
- [ ] add top level logfile calling out:
  - buffer open
  - buffer close
  - buffer save
  - change of active buffer
- [ ] need per buffer/directory '+errors' style buffer that can also operate something like
      vim's quickfix list (possibly need a top level one as well then?)

-- Structural regular expressions --
- [ ] FEATURE: Piping through a shell command
- [ ] FEATURE: Replace without output from a shell command
- [ ] Look at running grouped expressions in parallel a-la Sam
      - This should be doable by pre-computing the match positions and tracking any edit
        offsets that have built up
- [ ] Storing the history of previous edit commands and allowing for cycling through
      them would be helpful (same for Command mode).
