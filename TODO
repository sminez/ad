-- BUGS --
- [!] The regex engine "WordBoundary" assertion doesn't work correctly around ~alts~ sub expressions
  - See the failing test cases in lex::tests and regex::vm::tests for details of the behaviour
  - It looks as though the assertion after _might_ be working? But the one before definitely isn't
    behaving correctly
  -> I think this is actually around the behaviour of assertions at the start of input when iterating
     through all matches and being able to distinguish "start of match input" from "start of text"
     - This only really matters for iteration where we need to offset into the input to find the next
       match of the regex, so it might be better to have a way of handling this just for that case
       rather than complicating the main matching API.
- [!] Dragging the cursor back over itself is broken in a way I don't fully understand
      yet.
- [!] buffer details for the initial scratch file seem to cause errors when requesting
      the control file details through fsys?
      - Also seems to happen with a new file that is being created
      - It _might_ be something to do with special handling around naming new files?

-- Misc / Editor features --
- [ ] FEATURE: store "desired x" or an "x is at EOL" flag?
- [ ] FEATURE: mini-buffer tab complete
- [ ] FEATURE: completion of command mode commands
      - To start with this should be simple enough for handling just what is built in
        but supporting listing external scripts and tools would be nice as well
- [ ] FEATURE: support opening and navigating directories
- [ ] FEATURE: support using the minibuffer as a dmenu-like feature exposed through the
               filesystem interface

-- Fsys --
- [ ] sed edit in place doesn't seem to work because it needs to be able to create temp
      files right next to the file that is being edited.
      - "cat mnt/buffers/1/body | sed 's/test/TEST/' >mnt/buffers/1/body" just truncates
        the file but this is normal behaviour for sed so not an issue with ad
- [ ] decide on the event format for the events file and implement the events file
- [ ] add top level logfile calling out:
  - buffer open
  - buffer close
  - buffer save
  - change of active buffer
- [ ] need per buffer/directory '+errors' style buffer that can also operate something like
      vim's quickfix list (possibly need a top level one as well then?)

-- Structural regular expressions --
- [ ] FEATURE: Piping through a shell command
- [ ] FEATURE: Replace without output from a shell command
- [ ] Look at running grouped expressions in parallel a-la Sam
      - This should be doable by pre-computing the match positions and tracking any edit
        offsets that have built up
- [ ] Storing the history of previous edit commands and allowing for cycling through
      them would be helpful (same for Command mode).
