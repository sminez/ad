:: TODO

- [ ] FEATURE: Edit log transactions
- [ ] FEATURE: center screen on current line
- [ ] FEATURE: expand tab
- [ ] implement remaining text objects
   >> The implementation for these is yet another way of hunting through the buffer for
      a certain position. Now that the regex engine works it might actually be simpler
     (though probably not faster) to just use that for all text object style Dot changes?
  - Target character
  - Delimited between a given character pair
- [ ] FEATURE: match indent
- [ ] FEATURE: store "desired x" or an "x is at EOL" flag?
- [ ] FEATURE: mini-buffer tab complete
- [ ] FEATURE: completion of command mode commands
  - To start with this should be simple enough for handling just what is built in
    but supporting listing external scripts and tools would be nice as well
- [!] Dragging the cursor back over itself is broken in a way I don't fully understand
      yet.

-- Fsys --
- [!] buffer details for the initial scratch file seem to cause errors when requesting
      the control file details through fsys?
      - Also seems to happen with a new file that is being created
      - It _might_ be something to do with special handling around naming new files?
- [ ] sed edit in place doesn't seem to work because it needs to be able to create temp
      files right next to the file that is being edited.
      - "cat mnt/buffers/1/body | sed 's/test/TEST/' >mnt/buffers/1/body" just truncates
        the file but this is normal behaviour for sed so not an issue with ad
- [ ] need to detect an existing Fuse mount and handle the conflict gracefully

-- Structural regular expressions --
- [ ] FEATURE: Piping through a shell command
- [ ] FEATURE: Replace without output from a shell command
- [ ] Look at running grouped expressions in parallel a-la Sam
  - This should be doable by pre-computing the match positions and tracking any edit
    offsets that have built up
- [ ] Storing the history of previous edit commands and allowing for cycling through
      them would be helpful (same for Command mode).
- [ ] Update the current "Command Mode" dummy mode to just take a string for the mode
      name so that it can be re-used nicely rather than just calling EVERYTHING using
      the single line mini-buffer "command mode" in the UI.
