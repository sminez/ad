-- BUGS --
- [!] Dragging the cursor back over itself is broken in a way I don't fully understand
      yet.
- [!] buffer details for the initial scratch file seem to cause errors when requesting
      the control file details through fsys?
      - Also seems to happen with a new file that is being created
      - It _might_ be something to do with special handling around naming new files?

-- Misc / Editor features --
- [ ] FEATURE: Edit log transactions
	  - paste should always be a new transaction
- [ ] implement remaining text objects
      >> The implementation for these is yet another way of hunting through the buffer for
         a certain position. Now that the regex engine works it might actually be simpler
         (though probably not faster) to just use that for all text object style Dot changes?
      - Target character
      - Delimited between a given character pair
- [ ] FEATURE: store "desired x" or an "x is at EOL" flag?
- [ ] FEATURE: mini-buffer tab complete
- [ ] FEATURE: completion of command mode commands
      - To start with this should be simple enough for handling just what is built in
        but supporting listing external scripts and tools would be nice as well
- [ ] FEATURE: auto-reload files when they are modified on disk
      - This is a feature that has saved me countless times when pulling changes from git
        so it really does need to be there, but having this implemented cross platform
        is likely going to bring in a bunch of dependencies.
      - The notify crate (https://crates.io/crates/notify) seems to be what a lot of things
        use but it brings in mio it seems so the other inter-thread communication pieces
        _really_ should all make use of the same sort of event loop rather than having
        multiple, but that'll likely make things a lot more fiddly compared to using mpsc
        channels.
- [ ] FEATURE: support opening and navigating directories

-- Fsys --
- [ ] sed edit in place doesn't seem to work because it needs to be able to create temp
      files right next to the file that is being edited.
      - "cat mnt/buffers/1/body | sed 's/test/TEST/' >mnt/buffers/1/body" just truncates
        the file but this is normal behaviour for sed so not an issue with ad
- [ ] need to detect an existing Fuse mount and handle the conflict gracefully

-- Structural regular expressions --
- [ ] FEATURE: Piping through a shell command
- [ ] FEATURE: Replace without output from a shell command
- [ ] Look at running grouped expressions in parallel a-la Sam
      - This should be doable by pre-computing the match positions and tracking any edit
        offsets that have built up
- [ ] Storing the history of previous edit commands and allowing for cycling through
      them would be helpful (same for Command mode).
