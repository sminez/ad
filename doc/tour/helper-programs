plugins for ad are written using the filesystem interface:

    - the ad GitHub repo contains some example scripts and library functions to help with writing
      shell scripts to interact with ad:

        ../../data/lib/ad.sh
        ../../data/bin

    - there is also the ad_client crate which provides a way to interact with ad from Rust:

        ../../crates/ad_client

    - so long as you have a 9p client you can use whatever language you wish to write programs that
      interact with ad

    - if you also mount ad via fuse, all you need is the ability to read and write files!
