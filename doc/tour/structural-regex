structural regular expressions:

    - the Edit command from the last slide looked a lot like a standard sed expression:

          Edit , s/mouse/clicky thing/g

    - but the syntax supported in ad is a lot richer than you might be expecting if
      programs like sed and grep are what you had in mind.

    - the command language here is inspired by the one found in acme which originated in
      another plan 9 text editor, sam.
