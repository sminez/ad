This file is a demo of how you can use structural regular expressions to edit and
reformat text within ad. If you highlight each of the Edit lines below in order
and execute them you will be able to follow the transformation of the formatted
text below into rust data that can be wrapped in "vec![ ... ]" so that it will
format into what you can find in ../../src/editor/built_in_commands.rs

Edit 12,38 x/.*\n/ y/\s+-- / x/(.+)/ c/"$1"/
Edit 12,38 x/"(.+)"\s+--/ c/vec!["$1"],/
Edit 12,38 x/"(.+) \| (.+)"/ c/"$1", "$2"/
